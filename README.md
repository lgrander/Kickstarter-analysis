# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Analyze the success of crowdfunding for plays through kickstarts biased on the launch date of the fundraiser and the goal of the fundraiser. 


## Purpose
To use Kickstarter data to select launch dates and goals for future projects that will lead to the most success. The analysis can also be used to advise future clients on the parameter of their Kickstarter and what is most likely to lead to their success in funding their play. In what month are campaigns most successful? What campaign goals lead to the most success?


## Analysis and Challenges
I fit a linear model to predict the success of a campaign to include launch date and project goal as predictors. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Image 1 creates a visual depicting the percentage of success, failure and cancelations that occurred in each range of campaign goals of play fundraisers.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Image 2 creates a visual depicting the count of success, failure and cancelations that occurred in each play fundraised campaign relative to the launch date of that campaign.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges encountered would be formatting the visualization so that it communicated the data concisely without implying additional parameters.


Results

•	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Campaigns launched in February, May, October and November have the highest number of 	successful campaigns.

	Campaigns launched in January, June, July and October have the highest number of failed 	campaigns.

•	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	The likelihood of the campaigns success drops as the goal increases from 1000 to 49999.

•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The data set does not account for play genres. Romance for example could account for 90% 	of the successful campaigns significantly lowering your 
	likelihood of success if you are fundraising for a thriller. The data does not currently account 	for the genre parameter.



•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Percentages for successful, failed, and canceled campaigns relative to launch date. 
	Count of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns relative to campaign goals.
	Expand parameter on both charts depiction the success, failed, and Canceled campaigns 	relative to genre.
